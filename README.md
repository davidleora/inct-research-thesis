# Research Thesis: Car Racing Simulator Using Unity ML-Agents

This repository contains the LaTeX file for my research thesis on creating a car racing simulator using Unity ML-Agents.

## Thesis Overview

### Objective

The primary goal of this research is to develop a car racing simulator where an AI agent, trained using Unity's ML-Agents, can drive autonomously, avoiding collisions with other vehicles.

### Methodology

- **Simulator Development**: Created a car racing model in Unity with both one-way and two-way traffic scenarios.
- **ML-Agents**: Utilized Unity's ML-Agents toolkit to train the car agent.
- **Training**: The car agent was trained to drive and avoid collisions with other cars.

### Results

- The trained car agent is capable of navigating through traffic and avoiding collisions most of the time.
- Although the agent still occasionally collides with other cars, it demonstrates significant avoidance behavior.

## Repository Contents

- **Thesis LaTeX File**: The main LaTeX file documenting the research, methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

## Usage

To compile the thesis, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MikTeX) and use a LaTeX editor (e.g., TeXShop, Overleaf) to compile the `.tex` file.

## Note

This repository is intended for academic purposes and documents my research process and findings.
